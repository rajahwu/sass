### Problem

CSS week in boot camp was great. I was able to take my understanding of CSS to the next level. One problem I noticed was my code was very WET. I used imports to separate my files, but a lot of the files had the same CSS in each of them.

### Reason for SASS as  solution

I am looking to SASS to help solve this problem. I learned this week that I am experienced enough with CSS to begin to learn more efficient ways to use it and I do see frameworks as a real solution to the issues I have with CSS. With SASS, I will pretty much have a framework of my own. This will give me more ability to demonstrate my skill, and maybe even sell CSS templates.
